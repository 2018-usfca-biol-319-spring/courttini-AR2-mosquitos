# Introduction

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is an ecological observation facility that collects data on rapidly changing ecological processes in the United States. NEON has standardized data from 81 field sites that span across the United States within 20 Eco-climatic domains that represent regions of distinct land forms, vegetation, climate, and ecosystem dynamics. NEON measures the causes and effects of environmental change in different types of environments and data sets. 

The different types of field sites include core terrestrial sites, core aquatic sites, relocatable terrestrial sites, and relocatable aquatic sites. The different sites ensure that the data will statistically represent ecological, physical, and biological differences spanning the continent. As seen from the image below, the field sites are also in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. This image shows where the NEON sites are located including where the four different types of sites are located.

At the varying sites multiple different functional groups of dry mass are recorded depending the location of the site. This includes dry mass of flowers, leaves, mixed, needles, other, seeds, twigs/branches, and woody material. NEON also chose to observe small mammals as they are common to almost every place and they are receptive to changes in the environment. These small mammals are based on a couple different characteristics including taxonomic, behavior, dietary, and size. This data is important for in the use of public health issues like disease prevalence, accounting for the amount of species that are in certain environments, and specifically for climate changes and land use. Specifically, this project looks at a data set on mosquitos at each site.  


Delete this placeholder text, and replace it with your introduction text. You should include background on the NEON project including proper citations (e.g. [@thorpe2016introduction]), the sets of sites you are comparing, and other relevent background information related to your specific hypotheses, including perhaps information on the mosquito sampling design [@hoekman2016design].

Because species *Aedes communis* has the trait of living in woodland pools, we should see it only in the spring season at terrestrial sites back east and not in the others.


# Methods

The mosquito data of this report came from the Terrestrial Observation System (TOS) protocol and procedure for mosquito sampling. The was done by capturing the mosquitos at the varrious sites accross the United States. According to the, "NEON User Guide to Mosquitoes sampled from CO2 traps and Mosquito-borne pathogen status" mosquitos are sampled in the field using CDC CO2 light traps. Then, they are then sent to a facility where the mosquitos are arranged and identified by species, sex, etc. Mosquitos are a diverse and widespread family of insects that have been extensivelt studied becasue of their ecological and epidemiological significance. 

The design for capturing the mosquitos followed a protocal that is a spatially-balanced stratified random design. The field collection of the live mosqitos was conducted using Cneters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CO2 light traps. These light traps included a cylindrical cooler to hold dry ice, a plastic cover attached to a light with a fan and a mesh cup for collection of the mosquitos. The dry ice releases CO2 and this gas attracts the mosquitos so they can be collected. This protocal design includes ten mosquito points per site and are randomly distributed within each National Land Cover Database (NLCD). These mosquito traps were placed so they were easily road accessible (5-45 m). Sampling would occur every two weeks at core sites, and every four weeks at relocatable sites when their was adult mosquitos present. Traps were set at night for about 16 hours and then collected, then traps were reset from the times of 8-10 in the morning and kept out for 8 hours for collection. Samples are then collected from the day and reset again for the night sample. This happens for 40 continuous sampling hours. The date the trap was set, and collection time was recorded for each collection sample. Once the mosquito season had ended, then sampling was conducted once a week.    

The sites I chose to look at were affiliated with two different species: *Aedes communis* and *Aedes canadensis*. These species were chosen as they like to reside in woodland pools and I want to see where these two species are located accross the sites and their abundance has anything to do with elevation. Most of the analysis will be done with *Aedes communis* and the second species *Aedes canadensis* was used for comparison as they are in the same Genus. The sites I am looking at are Bartlett Experimental Forest (BART), Blandy Experimental Farm (BLAN), Delta Junction (DEJU), Disney Wilderness Preserve (DSNY), Harvard Forest (HARV), Healy (HEAL), Jones Ecological Research Center (JERC), Oak Ridge (ORNL), Ordway-Swisher Biological Station (OSBS), Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), Steigerwaldt Land Services (STEI), Talladega National Forest (TALL), Treehaven (TREE), The University of Kansas Field Station (UKFS), and UNDERC (UNDE). This mosquito data will be analyzed using R to create boxplots, point graphs, and a statistical summary with a P value to determine if there are significant differences of certain type of species at varying elevations and where these species are located across the US. Because these mosquitos have frequent affiliations with humans and ability to survive in modified environments by humans, the study of mosquitos and their ecology needs to be more widely studies. NEON is testing mosquitos to determine as well if they are significantly affected by land use changes. 

# Results

Add a number of code chunks in the Results section. These should read in, subset and plot the data as needed (no need to save any figures to pdf, since they will be put into the rendered document when you click 'knit'), and, for any hypotheses that you want to test, an appropriate statistical test. You should have at least 5 figures and/or tables in this section, which you use to test your hypotheses against the dataset. I've included some starter code to read in and merge the two datasets. You should build on this code for your own analyses.

```{r load-packages}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("ggplot2")

```

```{r read-in-datasets}
# this is the information on each of the trapping locations and trapping events
mos_trapping <- read_csv("data/raw_data/mos_trapping.csv")

# this is the info about the taxonomic identity of mosquitos found in the traps
mos_expert <- read_csv("data/raw_data/mos_expertTaxonomistIDProcessed.csv")
```

```{r join-datasets}
# split the 'subsampleID' column into two new columns, including one called
# 'sampleID' that we can use to match to the other dataset
mos_expert <- mos_expert %>%
  separate(subsampleID,
           into = c("sampleID", "subsample_number"),
           sep = "\\.S\\.")

# join the two datasets together based on the shared 'sampleIS' column
mos_all <- mos_expert %>%
  full_join(mos_trapping, by = "sampleID", suffix = c(".taxa", ".sample"))
```

```{r filter-by-speciesA}
mos_communis <- mos_all %>%
  filter(scientificName == "Aedes communis") %>%
  group_by(siteID.sample) %>%
  tally() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# Discussion

There is a correlation between individual mean count of the species *Aedes communis* and elevation. The P value was less than 0.05 (0.000593), so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between mosquitos captured and their elevation. There is a significant relationship between elevation and mosquito abundance. 

Discuss the results you found in the context of what you know about the site/sites and the predominant types of vegatation in those locations. Think also about the community dynamics of the mammal community at each of the sites, in the context of what you know about different types of species interactions, food webs, trophic transfer, etc.
